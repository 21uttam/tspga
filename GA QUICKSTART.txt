The quickstart guide contains the information required for getting started
running the GA as well as information on modifying basic GA settings and
information regarding how to enable real-time plotting. Important dependencies
and gotchas are also listed.

**The python scripts require Python 2.6**
**The perl script responsible for real-time plotting may require the
installation of a library***

To Run the GA:

1) Generate a tsp: 
      python tsp-builder.py <# cities> <min cost> <max cost>

2) Find the optimal solution (look for it in concorde's output):
      ./concorde tsp.tsp

3) Load the optimal solution into the tspga.cpp setting:
      #define BEST_PATH <optimal solution>

4) Change any other desired settings in the tspga.cpp #defines 
   ex: GA settings--mutation rate, population size, elitism %
   ex: plotting output--set either of the #defines (PLOT_ITER, PLOT_FIT)
       to true and the GA will output data for gnuplot (see step 8)
      
5) Rebuild the GA:
      make

6) Generate initial paths for the GA (make sure the # of paths equals 
   the population size!):
      python tsp-initial-paths.py <# cities> <# of paths to generate>

7) Control the parallelism by setting the number of OpenMP threads:
      export OMP_NUM_THREADS=<# threads>

8) Run the GA:
      ./tspga
      
      Or with real-time plotting: 
      ./tspga | ./feedGnuplot.pl --stream
      
      Note: if using real-time plotting the program must be manually terminated
      (ctrl-c) because gnuplot will wait indefinitely for streaming input.
      
      Note: real time plotting has not been tested on bluegrit.
      

Shortcuts:

To re-run the GA: use step 8

To re-run the GA with a different number of threads: use steps 7, 8

To re-run the GA with different GA settings: use steps 4, 5, 8
   **If you change the population size: use steps 4, 5, 6, 8

To re-run the GA with a different seed population: use steps 6, 8

To re-run the GA on a new TSP: redo all the steps
